# Nope

## About
Nope gives Node.JS Object Oriented Programming in a traditional class style syntax.

Nope provides the extremely rich Joose system for letting you easily build
objects ("Classes") and use them with traditional patterns such as Singletons.

It also provides an autoloader like other languages, so you can specify where
your apps code base lies, and then simply never worry about requiring() and
storing the result to a variable to use, letting you rapidly build your
application.

## Install
Nope is ready to be installed from NPM, but may also be manually added
to your project with git submodules. First CD to your project root.
Ensure a directory named `node_modules` exists if using git.

  - Install with NPM:
     - `npm install nope`
     
  - Install with GIT:
     - As a submodule:
        - `git submodule add git://github.com/aikar/nope node_modules/nope`
        - `git submodule update --init --recursive`

## Usage
Nope returns a function from its module which allows you to register autoloaders.

First say you have projectroot/lib/Foo/Bar.js with

    Class({
        methods: {
            initialize: function() {
                console.log("Foo.Bar initialized")
            }
        }
    });

Then in your projectroot/mylib.js

    var autoload = require('nope')    
    autoload(__dirname + '/lib')
    
    new Foo.Bar();
    
Will echo to screen "Foo.Bar initialized"
